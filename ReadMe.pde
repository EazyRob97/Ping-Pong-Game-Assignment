Programme Name: PingPong Game

Brief description of the animation achieved:
This is one of the most common and significant games that was ever invented, it requires 
a smooth slippery surface and two paddles and a device to keep track of scores.
Known bugs/problems:
Null I had common errors like void error, maybe missing colon, void expected.
I had other errors especially in trying to develop a detection of collision in the event
for when the ball hits the paddle etc. I will be mentioning some further problems that I had in my interview.
Any sources referred to during the development of the assignment (no need to reference lecture/lab materials):
I did use some resources from processing.org but understanding it first before implementing and
I also looked up on processing.org/ and on youtube on how to do a gradient fill for a background using primary colors which is a for
loop feature but first I had to understand it before implementing which I found very tricky at
first but it is making sense to me now. I implemented a nested for function as well but as a result it causes my java program to run very slow when I implement a nested for function but I left it in as a comment to see what you think of it when you test it out, whether I deserve in the  bonus mark for the nested for function.
